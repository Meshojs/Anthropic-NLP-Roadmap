# Anthropic‑NLP‑Roadmap — I Built It and Here’s What It Is

I built **Anthropic‑NLP‑Roadmap** as a practical, hands‑on learning journey from basic machine learning to core natural language processing (NLP) skills. This isn’t just a list of topics — I wrote real notebooks and code you can run, explore, and learn from. ([github.com](https://github.com/Meshojs/Anthropic-NLP-Roadmap/tree/main))

## 🧠 What I Did

I structured this roadmap so that you:

- **Start with foundational machine learning basics**  
- **Move into neural networks and PyTorch models**  
- **Then transition into NLP workflows and text processing**

Everything is written with real Python code, exercises, and explanations — not just theory.

## 📁 How It’s Organized

Anthropic‑NLP‑Roadmap/
├─ Block1‑M/
│ ├─ weekone/
│ └─ weektwo/
├─ Block2‑M/
│ └─ weekone/
├─ README.md



### 📌 Breakdown

- **Block1‑M:** Machine learning fundamentals  
  - `weekone`: I built regression models and simple neural networks.  
  - `weektwo`: I wrote classification projects and a PyTorch MNIST model.  
- **Block2‑M:** NLP basics  
  - `weekone`: I created text preprocessing and NLP notebooks that teach tokenization, stemming, and language‑level parsing.  
Each block is intentional — I wrote the code to teach you step by step.

## 🛠 Tools You’ll Use

In this roadmap I used:

- **Python** for all coding
- **NumPy & Pandas** for data handling
- **PyTorch** for deep learning
- **Scikit‑learn** for utilities
- **NLTK / SpaCy** for text processing

These tools are industry‑standard so as you go through the notebooks, you’re learning real skills, not just textbook theory.

## ✨ What You Actually Build

Here’s what you’ll work with:

| Notebook | What You Learn |
|----------|----------------|
| House Price Prediction | Neural networks from scratch |
| Student Grade Prediction | Regression with clean data |
| Titanic Survival | Binary classification logic |
| MNIST Digit Recognition | Deep learning model with PyTorch |
| NLP Foundations | Tokenization, clean text, basic feature extraction |

I wrote all of them so you can see **how theory becomes code**. ([github.com](https://github.com/Meshojs/Anthropic-NLP-Roadmap/tree/main))

## 🎯 Why It Matters

I didn’t just link resources — I *built runnable code* that guides you through learning. You’ll end up with a portfolio of notebooks and real projects you can point to, not just notes or slides.

By the end of this roadmap, you’ll be able to write and understand real ML and NLP code, and you’ll be ready to take on your own advanced projects.
